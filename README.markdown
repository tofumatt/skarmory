# Skarmory — It's Super Effective! #

## A JavaScript Twitter Library for Appcelerator Titanium ##

![In-game image of the Pokémon Skarmory](http://github.com/tofumatt/skarmory/raw/master/skarmory.png) Skarmory is a JavaScript Twitter library for [Appcelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/) that implements Twitter's REST API and OAuth authorization flow. It's named after the Pokémon [Skarmory](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Skarmory), the only dual-type Steel/Flying Pokémon in existence.

Thanks to [David Riccitelli](http://ziodave.tumblr.com/) for writing [oauth_adapter.js](http://code.google.com/p/oauth-adapter/), which gave me some ideas on how to write this library.
